Important Instructions for Sending in Expense Reports:

·       Prepare your expense report.

·       Once completed, click on the print button at the top.

·       A box requesting you to select the appropriate type of report will be displayed.  Select either Receipt Report or Detail Report based on the following specifications:

1.      Receipt Report - This report must be printed and sent to accounting. This report has a bar code on it that is needed for the accounting department to scan in your report. It also tells you which receipts must be sent in with the receipt report.

2.      Detail Report - Do not send this report to accounting (it has no bar code).  This report is more appropriate for the traveler or the person that prepares the report in case they would like to keep a paper copy.


·       Once you have printed the receipt report and attached the receipts, you must send all expense reports in the white A/P envelope with the open slot at the right hand corner (the bar code must be seen through this slot).


**If you follow these instructions when sending in your expense reports, the receipts will be scanned much more quickly.  If you do not use the correct envelope or do not send the correct report, it will significantly slow down the process.

 |  |  |  |  |-  sender: Puthigai  Savita (Savita.Puthigai@ENRON.com)
email.body We have made the  following modifications to the EnronOnline applications.

Stack Manager Changes

Fill Order Enhancements - (Effective Tuesday September 25)
·       To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill.        
·       The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides.
·       The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
·       Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
·       Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
·       If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

 |  |  |  |  |-  sender: Lee  Dennis (Dennis.Lee@ENRON.com)
email.body During our Envision training session the question came up as to whether or not we can send documents to our customers from Envision via Email.

After working with Sylvia Thomas, the answer is yes and no.  Yes, we can get documents form Envision to the customer easily.  No we can't do it through Email.
Sylvia and her team, however, are going to look into the possibility of being able to send information from Envision securely through Email.

In the meantime, you can fax information directly from Envision to your customer.  Directions are attached.  If you have any questions or problems, feel free to call.

 |  |  |  |  |- Email: 2097828 - Supported Internet Email Addresses
 |  |  |  |  |-  sender: Enron Messaging Administration (/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=ENRON)
email.body Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.
Enron Messaging Administration

Our True-Quote rep is Kelly Stroud at 713-350-1008.  If Jim wants to call
her to find out some info, he can tell her he got the number from Calpine.
I have only met Kelly Stroud a couple of times and she will remember me
because I was taking motorcycle classes when I met her and she used to ride
bikes.
Good Luck
Lisa

email.body Electricity Deregulation is coming to Texas!
What a great way to start off the New Year - to be able to choose your electricity provider, which could mean potential savings for you and your family on your electric bill.  As you know, Enron has been a leader in lobbying for deregulation and a consumer's right to choose energy providers.

For the first time in our state's history, 5 percent of Texas households will have this golden opportunity.  The NewPower Company (NewPower), which is approximately 45 percent owned by Enron, was recently formed to provide energy and energy-related services to residential customers in deregulating energy markets across America, including Texas.  For a limited time, Houston-based employees will be eligible to participate in NewPower's pilot program offering their deregulated electric service.

Be Among the First to Participate:
Enrollment with NewPower begins March 12.  Also, watch for a special Enron Employees Exclusive offer on your desk March 12.  If you would like more information about NewPower, visit the company's web site at www.newpower.com

Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, or any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.

I already have Road Runner cable internet service at home.  How can I be under the "discounted Enron plan?"  Do I need to cancel and start over or can my bills automatically be reflected?  Thanks.

If I were you I would take Hwy 290 to Sam Houston Tollway, take beltway to I-45, then

take I-45 North and exit Kuykendahl - turn left under freeway and when you get to

light (not  feeder light) but approx one block later there will be the light @Kuykendahl - turn

right and stay on Kuykendahl all the way - you will pass the intersection at FM1960 and

then I think at the next light  or one after that is "WOERNER RD"  TURN RIGHT AND APPROX

1/2 BLOCK down you'll see sign on left "Shirley Acres" - its in the trees.....thats the place



See the red star above that is "Woerner Rd" and see where you exit off I-45 on Rankin/Kuykendalh exit,

go left under freeway and then turn right onKuykendahl....  You can come all the way down 1960 from Hwy 249

but thats a long slow trip with a lot of lights and traffic.....

Pray for sunshine and warm weather....

Caio bene'

be ok for printing.  If you want to use the picture for desktop wallpaper,
let me know your screen resolution (i.e. 1024x768); I will make a file

email.body E-Trade to put ATMs, brokerage shops in Target stores
04/11 07:51  <javascript:openNewsWebSite()>  <javascript:openNewsWebSite()>
NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - E-Trade Group Inc. (ET), the No. 2 U.S. Internet brokerage, on Wednesday said it had agreed to put 20 E-Trade shops and more than 1,000 bank machines into Target Corp. (TGT) stores nationwide.
E-Trade will be the exclusive automated teller machine network for all Target and Target Greatland stores in the United States. E-Trade currently has ATMs in 110 Target stores.
The E-Trade shops -- "E-Trade Zones" -- are 400-square-foot facilities within SuperTarget stores staffed with sales and service representatives where customers can open a brokerage account. E-Trade and Target launched a pilot program for the stores in September with an E-Trade Zone in Roswell, Ga.

email.body One morning Dick Cheney and George W. Bush were having brunch at a
restaurant.

The attractive waitress asks Cheney what he would like and he replies, "I'll
have a bowl of oatmeal and some fruit."

"And what can I get for you, sir?" she asks George W.

He replies, "How about a quickie?"

"Why, Mr. President," the waitress says, "How rude . . . you're starting to
act like Mr. Clinton and you haven't even been in office for a month yet!"

As the waitress storms away, Cheney leans over to Bush and whispers, "It's
pronounced "quiche."

email.body  YOU KNOW YOU'RE FROM HOUSTON IF:
The "farm-to-market" roads have seven lanes.

You have to turn on the air conditioning in January, two days after a low of
29 degrees.

Everybody has a story of the Flying Roach the size of the Taco Bell
Chihuahua.

When you see your neighbor dancing around the front yard, you don't think
he's won the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes; you know that he just
stepped in a fire ant bed.

You're on your way to work one FEBRUARY morning and suddenly you're trapped
in a traffic jam caused by a chuck wagon and fifty horses - with riders -
and you look around to see that everybody in the trucks around you is
wearing a cowboy hat.

The name "Bud Adams" makes people snarl, and "Bum Phillips" doesn't mean bad
screwdriver.

"Luv ya Blue" still makes you smile, even if you did run the Oilers out of
town.

You know that the Astrodome will always be the Eighth Wonder of the World.

You come to work in short sleeves and walk out at noon to find that a "blue
norther" has blown through and the temperature has dropped 40 degrees.

Your neighbor's Christmas yard decorations are a re-creation of the gunfight
at the OK Corral, complete with a ten-foot tree decorated with boots and
cowboy hats, and a Santa Claus who looks a lot like Wyatt Earp.

You wander into a section of town where you can't read the street signs
because they're written in Asian characters instead of English, but you
don't care because you can get great prices on fake designer merchandise.

You go to an art festival and you're almost run down by handholding cross
dressers on roller blades.

You hear everything but English spoken when you go to the Galleria to window
shop. (You can't afford to buy because the prices are jacked up for all the
foreign tourists.)

You know that "Dad gummit" has nothing to do with your father's failure to
practice good dental hygiene.

You think "Y'all" is perfectly good usage if you're referring to more than
one person.

For a Chili Cook off, you'll use anything from armadillo to frog's legs, but
you know that the only GOOD chili is made with chopped - not ground beef,
and it has NO beans and NO tomatoes.

Spring is not the season, Katy is not the lady, and 1960 is not the year.

Society matrons of "a certain age" still sport big hair and faces that have
gone east, west, and north rather than south.

You can leave your house, head out of town, and an hour later you still
haven't left the city limits. (During rush hour, you haven't left your
NEIGHBORHOOD.)

You've never seen I-45 and I-10 in any condition other than under
construction - and you've lived here for more than 30 years.

You know that "Clutch City" has nothing to do with automobile transmissions.

"The Dream" is not a fantasy.

The only REAL Mexican food is Tex-Mex.

A 747 with the Space Shuttle riding piggyback has actually flown low right
overhead, and nobody paid any attention to it.

You know that while saving you money, "Mattress Mac" has amassed more than
the U.S. treasury.

You're happy to have beaten Los Angeles out of a football team, but you'd
rather they keep the title of "Smog Capital."

You see nothing unusual about an eighty-something former sheriff's deputy
who wears a white pompadour toupee and blue sunglasses, mispronounces names,
allows televising of his frequent plastic surgeries, seems unnaturally
obsessed with slime in the ice machine, and screams, "MAR-VIN ZIND-ler,
iiiii-witness news" into a television camera every night.  But some folks
are still upset with him for shutting down the Chicken Ranch.

If the humidity is below 90 percent, it's a GOOD hair day.

email.body And to start off the week.....



California's new State Song! The Rolling Blackout Theme Song
(To the theme music from the TV western "Rawhide")
Rollin', rollin', rollin',
Though the state is golden,
Keep them blackouts rollin', statewide.
A little colder weather,
And we all freeze together,
Wishin' more plants were on the line.
All the things I'm missin',
Like lights and television,
Are waiting 'til we can pay the price.
(Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide!
Keep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapprovin',
Keep them rates a-movin', statewide.
Don't try to understand 'em,
Just raise, charge, and collect 'em.
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.
My heart's calculatin',
Nuclear plants will be waitin',
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.
(Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide!
STATEWIDE! Hyaah!

Subject: FW: Even For You
Because in some ways, you have these traits and must
do these things as well.
Mother's Day
If you send this to just one person, it should make it
all the way around
by Mother's Day.
This is for all the mothers who have sat up all night
with sick toddlers
in their arms, wiping up barf laced with Oscar Mayer
wieners and cherry
Kool-Aid saying, "It's OK honey, Mommy's here."
Who walk around the house all night with their babies
when they keep
crying and won't stop.
This is for all the mothers who show up at work with
spit-up in their
hair and milk stains on their blouses and diapers in
their purse.
For all the mothers who run carpools and make cookies
and sew Halloween
costumes. And all the mothers who DON'T.
This is for the mothers who gave birth to babies
they'll never see. And
the mothers who took those babies and gave them homes.
This is for all the mothers who froze their buns off
on metal bleachers
at football or soccer games Friday night instead of
watching from cars, so
that when their kids asked, "Did you see me?" they
could say, "Of course, I
wouldn't have missed it for the world," and mean it.
This is for all the mothers who yell at their kids in
the grocery store
and swat them in despair when they stomp their feet
like a tired 2-year old
who wants ice cream before dinner.
This is for all the mothers who sat down with their
children and
explained all about making babies. And for all the
mothers who wanted to but just couldn't.
For all the mothers who read "Goodnight, Moon" twice a
night for a year.
And then read it again.  "Just one more time."
This is for all the mothers who taught their children
to tie their
shoelaces before they started school. And for all the
mothers who opted for Velcro instead.
This is for all the mothers who teach their sons to
cook and their
daughters to sink a jump shot.
This is for all mothers whose heads turn automatically
when a little
voice calls "Mom?" in a crowd, even though they know
their own off spring are at home.
This is for all the mothers who sent their kids to
school with stomach
aches, assuring them they'd be just FINE once they got
there, only to get
calls from the school nurse an hour later asking them
to please pick them
up.  Right away.
This is for mothers whose children have gone astray,
who can't find the
words to reach them.
For all the mothers who bite their lips sometimes
until they bleed when
their 14 year olds dye their hair green.
What makes a good Mother anyway?
Is it patience?
Compassion?
Broad hips?
The ability to nurse a baby, cook dinner, and sew a
button on a shirt,
all at the same time?
Or is it heart? Is it the ache you feel when you watch
your son or
daughter disappear down the street, walking to school
alone for the very first
time?
The jolt that takes you from sleep to dread, from bed
to crib at 2 A.M.
to put your hand on the back of a sleeping baby?
The need to flee from wherever you are and hug your
child when you hear
news of a fire, a car accident, a child dying?
For all the mothers of the victims of all these school
shootings, and the
mothers of those who did the shooting. For the mothers
of the survivors,
and the mothers who sat in front of their TVs in
horror, hugging their child
who just came home from school, safely.
This is for mothers who put pinwheels and teddy bears
on their children's
graves.
This is for young mothers stumbling through diaper
changes and sleep
deprivation.
And mature mothers learning to let go.
For working mothers and stay-at-home mothers.
Single mothers and married mothers.
Mothers with money, mothers without.
This is for you all.
So hang in there.
Please pass along to all the Mom's in your life.
"Home is what catches you when you fall - and we all
fall."
Please pass this to all the wonderful mothers you
know.
(I just did)

China Blames U. S. for Second Mid-Air Collision

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese officials have stated that they are holding the
United States, "fully responsible" for today's mid-air collision, involving
several Chinese aircraft and one American craft. This comes just weeks after
a similar incident involving a U. S. spy plane.

Officials have stated that at approximately 8:25 a.m., GMT, a squadron of
Chinese F-8 fighters collided with the American Goodyear Blimp. The crash
left over a dozen Chinese planes downed and the blimp's electronic billboard
damaged. Sources say the billboard's scrolling marquee had been advertising
7-UP soft drink, leaving the line "Up yours" in view.

A Chinese pilot who witnessed the collision between his squadron, nicknamed,
"Panda Rash" told China's Xinhua news agency that he saw the American blimp
dive out of the clouds and into wingman Sum Yung Phucker's F-8 jet.

"I told Yung Phucker his tail was all broken. Keep it straight. Keep it
straight'," said the pilot. "He just couldn't shake the American
foreign-devil. The blimp then reportedly veered hard left and then
right,taking out the rest of the squadron.

Pilot Chawp Suey Wussy told Xinhua the American blimp was "fully responsible

for the incident," repeating the language Beijing has used in the earlier
incident. China blames this new accident on the Goodyear blimp, saying it
rammed the supersonic fighters, and has demanded an apology.  Officials from
the Goodyear Company have said it is unlikely that the slow propeller-driven
blimp could turn inside and ram a dozen nimble fighters, unless the Chinese
were testing chimp pilots.

"The direct cause of the collision was that the American blimp made a sudden
big move toward the Chinese planes, making it impossible for the Chinese
planes to get out of the way," Suey Wussy was quoted as saying.  "The savage
act of American blimps colliding with Chinese planes while conducting spying
activities at sporting events makes us indignant," he was quoted as saying.

Chinese officials are calling for an apology from the United States and
enough Goodyear tires to replace the Firestone's that experienced
spontaneous combustion last year. U. S. officials expressed regret, but
would not allow an apology until the matter could be investigated further.

In a related story Goodyear has not commented on whether it has stopped
shipments of condoms to China as a retaliatory measure.

I'm not sure if this  spreadsheet will work for you.  I don't remember the exact data you wanted,  so I did things from memory.  The dates may not be correct, because I  (multiplied the number of months * 30 days) then added this number to the start  date to project the ending period.  You know our our SAP software  automatically does things like this :)

If you want to make a monetary donation to the Red Cross or any other agency, I am pleased to report that the Enron matching gift program has been expanded to match your donation.

Enron is looking into other avenues to assist the victims but, we need to hear from you first.  Please email me or call me if you or a fellow employee has been affected.

Enron will be making determinations based on this information and how to proceed and assist the victims.

I can be reached at x33597 if you have any questions.

Thanks to the teamwork and dedication of the Transwestern Commercial team, we're well positioned to meet or exceed our 2001 goals.  While all of our employees have contributed to the success of TW's first six months of 2001, several individuals have made significant commercial contributions:

Lorraine, Michelle, and Jeff have successfully negotiated the Red Rock Expansion contracts within a record one month's time.  The value of these transactions is expected to have a positive impact on our revenue starting next year and into the future.

TK has negotiated creative interruptible transport deals at the California border, sold significant Park N' Ride volumes and negotiated several short-term index deals with a sharing mechanism that have had a strong impact on our bottom line.

Jeff  has also structured several long-term index-to-index deals and developed a hedging strategy to lock-in market rates.

Thank you for your hard work and innovation.  It demonstrates your commitment to excellence and to our Company.


Stan
